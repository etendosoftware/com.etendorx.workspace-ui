# PRD: Nightly Suite - Integration Tests Against Real Etendo Classic

Status: Draft (Phase 1 â€” Co-creation)

Purpose

This document defines the product requirements for a suite of integration tests that RUN against a real Etendo Classic server (no mocks), executed in a separate nightly pipeline. The goal is to validate end-to-end contracts between WorkspaceUI (BFF) and Classic under real conditions, detect integration regressions, and verify critical flows (datasource reads/writes, ERP forwards, cookie/CSRF policies).

Scope of this section (Summary and Objectives)

- Executive summary of the feature and its rationale.
- Measurable objectives of the nightly suite.
- Success criteria and main constraints.

Objectives (SMART)

1. Detect integration regressions between the BFF and Classic on critical flows: `/api/datasource` (read/write) and `/api/erp/*`.
2. Produce JUnit reports and artifacts (HTTP logs/responses) for each nightly run, with minimal traceability to reproduce failures.
3. Maintain a suite that, when run in a clean real environment, has a flake rate < 5% and uses retry/timeout rules compatible with the CI.
4. Ensure the nightly suite is independent from PR suites (fast and hermetic) and runs in a separate nightly pipeline.

Stakeholders

- Frontend Team (owner of the BFF / tests)
- Infra / QA Team (provides Classic environment and test credentials)
- Product owners who require stability in critical processes

Main Constraints

- This PRD assumes the Classic environment is already available and reset to a clean state for each run (provisioning and snapshots are out of scope for this document).
- Nightly tests are intentionally slower and must not block PR checks.

Feedback requested for this section

Is the purpose and the objectives clear? Should we add any additional measurable objective (for example, a maximum tolerated duration for the nightly suite) or any organizational constraint (time window for execution)?

If you confirm, I will continue with the next section: Detailed scope, Use Cases and Test Matrix (each case: inputs/outputs/acceptance criteria).
