# WorkspaceUI Monorepo

## Workflow for a monorepo with pnpm and submodules (dev environment)

### 1- Clone the repository

**Note:** This repository must be cloned in the modules_rx folder

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### 2- Pull git submodules

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 3- Install packages using pnpm

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 4- Run the main repository

```bash
 pnpm --filter @workspaceui/mainui dev
```

or navigate to the package folder and run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Add a new package to the workspace (from scratch)

### 1- Add the new package to the workspace

```bash
npm init vite@latest NameOfProject -- --template react-ts
```

### 2- Change the name of the package in the package.json file to the following format:

```json
{
  "name": "@workspaceui/nameOfProject",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  ...
}
```

### 3- In the root of the workspace, run the following command to add the new package to the main workspace:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 4- Add the new package to the .gitmodules file

```.gitmodules
[submodule "packages/nameOfProject"]
  path = packages/nameOfProject
  url = <repository-url>
```

### 5- Push the changes to the repository

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Add new package to the workspace" && git push
```

## Aditional commands:

### - To update all submodules

In the root of the workspace, run the following command:

```bash
git submodule update --recursive --remote
```

**Note:** This command will update all submodules to the latest commit in the remote repository. The workspace tracks the latest commit in the main repository, so you will have to commit the changes in the workspace after running this command.
This is an important step to keep all submodules in sync with the workspace repository.

### - To install any library in a specific package (from the workspace root) run:

```bash
pnpm --filter @workspaceui/componentlibrary add @mui/utils
```

or navigate to the package folder and run:

```bash
pnpm add @mui/utils
```

## Steps to create a monorepo with pnpm and submodules (from scratch)

### 1- Create a new repository

```bash
git init
```

#### 1.1- Install pnpm

Install pnpm globally if you haven't already.

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### 2- Init pnpm workspace

```bash
pnpm init
```

### 3- Add typescript to pnpm workspaces

```bash
pnpm add -D typescript ts-node -w
```

### 4- Configure pnpm-workspace.yaml

At the root of your workspace repository, create or update the pnpm-workspace.yaml to include paths to your submodules.

```yml
packages:
  - packages/\*
```

### 5- Add submodules to the repository

In this case, all repositories are builded as a Vite project with React and Typescript.
Create a repository and then excute the following command:

```bash
git submodule add <repository-url> packages/<project-name>
```

#### 5.1- Each repository have to have the same BASE package.json configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "@workspaceui/nameOfProject", // This is the name of the package in the workspace
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "serve": "vite preview"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "@workspaceui/projectdependency1": "workspace:^" // This is only required if you have dependencies between packages (ej. MainUI depends on ComponentLibrary)
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^1.0.0",
    "vite": "^2.6.4"
  }
}
```

### 6- Once all your packages are set up, go back to the root of your workspace and run:

```bash
pnpm install
```
