# üöÄ Etendo Main UI Installation

Welcome to the Etendo Main UI repository! This document provides a clear and formal guide on setting up and running the main user interface for Etendo.

## üõ† Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or higher recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (latest version)

Additionally, ensure you have the following repositories cloned in your workspace:

- `com.etendoerp.openapi`
- `com.etendoerp.etendorx`
- `com.etendoerp.metadata`
- `com.etendoerp.metadata.template`

**Note:** The latest developments are typically found in the `develop` branch.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Configuration (for data access)

To fetch data from the backend, you need to have **Etendo Classic running** with the necessary modules installed.

You can set it up in one of the following ways:

- Locally with all modules properly configured.
- **Using Docker** (recommended for quick setup):  
  Use the official repository:  
  [`https://github.com/etendosoftware/com.etendoerp.mainui`](https://github.com/etendosoftware/com.etendoerp.mainui)

Make sure the backend is running and accessible before interacting with data in the UI.
