# Table Selection Session Sync - User Guide

## What is Table Selection Session Sync?

Table selection session synchronization automatically maintains your record selection context across different parts of the Etendo WorkspaceUI application. When you select records in any data table, the system instantly updates the server session to reflect your current selection.

This feature ensures that your selections persist and are available for related operations throughout your workflow.

## Key Benefits

### üîÑ Seamless Navigation
Your record selections persist when moving between different screens, tabs, or windows within the application. No need to re-select records when navigating back to a table.

### ‚ö° Process Integration
Selected records are automatically available for batch operations, reports, and processes. The system knows which records you're working with without additional configuration.

### üöÄ Performance Optimized
Efficient synchronization that happens in the background without impacting table responsiveness or user interface performance.

### üõ°Ô∏è Reliable Operation
Robust error handling ensures that if synchronization temporarily fails, your table functionality continues to work normally.

## How It Works

### Automatic Operation
The session synchronization works automatically whenever you:
- Select individual records using checkboxes
- Select multiple records using Ctrl+Click or Shift+Click
- Use "Select All" functionality
- Clear selections

### Behind the Scenes
1. **Selection Detection**: The system detects when you change your record selection
2. **Smart Sync**: After a brief delay (to handle rapid selections), the system updates the server

4. **Ready for Use**: Selected records are now available for any related operations
