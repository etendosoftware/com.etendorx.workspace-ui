# **PRD-05: Implementation of Lazy Loading for Components**

**Status:** Proposed
**Owner:** Development Team
**Date:** 2024-07-25
**Priority:** HIGH

### **1. Problem**

Currently, the application loads all components of a page or view at once, including those that are not immediately visible to the user. This negatively impacts initial loading performance:

- **Increased Bundle Size:** Heavy components like modals (`ProcessDefinitionModal`), complex grids, or rich text editors are included in the initial bundle, even if the user never interacts with them.
- **Slow Initial Load Time:** The browser must download, parse, and execute more JavaScript than necessary when the page first loads, delaying the `Time to Interactive` (TTI).
- **Unnecessary Memory Usage:** Components that might never be used during the user's session are loaded into memory.

### **2. Proposed Solution**

We propose implementing a **Lazy Loading** strategy for components that are not critical for the initial render. The `next/dynamic` function will be used to achieve this.

Candidate components for lazy loading are:

1.  **Modals:** Any modal that opens in response to a user action (e.g., `ProcessDefinitionModal`).
2.  **Components in Inactive Tabs:** Content of tabs that are not visible by default.
3.  **Heavy "Below the Fold" Components:** Components that require the user to scroll to see them.
4.  **Third-Party Libraries:** Large libraries that are only used in specific components (e.g., charts, editors).

### **3. Technical Implementation**

#### **3.1. Using `next/dynamic`**

A centralized file will be created (or an existing one will be modified) to export dynamic versions of components.

```typescript
// components/LazyComponents.tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
import { ProcessModalSkeleton, GridSkeleton } from './Skeletons';

// The ProcessDefinitionModal component will not be loaded until an attempt is made to render it.
export const LazyProcessDefinitionModal = dynamic(
() => import('./ProcessModal/ProcessDefinitionModal'),
{
// Show a loading skeleton while the real component is being downloaded
loading: () => <ProcessModalSkeleton />,
// Disable Server-Side Rendering for components that rely on browser APIs
ssr: false
}
);

export const LazyWindowReferenceGrid = dynamic(
() => import('./ProcessModal/WindowReferenceGrid'),
{
loading: () => <GridSkeleton />,
ssr: false
}
);
```

#### **3.2. Integration into Parent Components**

Parent components will use the dynamic components, often within a `<Suspense>` boundary for a better user experience.

```jsx
// components/Window.tsx
import { Suspense, useState } from 'react';
import { LazyProcessDefinitionModal } from './LazyComponents';
import { ProcessModalSkeleton } from './Skeletons';

const Window = () => {
const [showProcessModal, setShowProcessModal] = useState(false);

return (
<>
<button onClick={() => setShowProcessModal(true)}>Open Process</button>

{/* The modal is only rendered (and downloaded) when showProcessModal is true */}
{showProcessModal && (
<Suspense fallback={<ProcessModalSkeleton />}>
<LazyProcessDefinitionModal
isOpen={showProcessModal}
onClose={() => setShowProcessModal(false)}
/>
</Suspense>
)}
</>
);
};
```

### **4. Success Metrics**

- **Reduced Initial Bundle Size:** A decrease in the main page's JavaScript bundle size by at least 30-40%, verified with `@next/bundle-analyzer`.
- **Improved First Contentful Paint (FCP):** A reduction in FCP time by at least 25%.
- **Separated JavaScript Chunks:** The build analysis should show separate JavaScript files (chunks) for each lazily loaded component.

### **5. Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] A list of at least 5-10 heavy component candidates for lazy loading has been identified.
- [ ] `next/dynamic` has been used to create lazy-loaded versions of these components.
- [ ] Appropriate `Skeleton` or `fallback` loading components have been implemented for each dynamic component.
- [ ] Parent components have been updated to use the `Lazy` versions of the components.
- [ ] The application functions correctly, and components load on demand when needed.
- [ ] The `npm run build` command and bundle analysis confirm that the dynamic components have been separated into their own chunks.
- [ ] The user experience during lazy loading is smooth and does not have layout shifts (CLS).
- [ ] The documentation in `docs/architecture` has been updated to reflect the lazy loading strategy.
