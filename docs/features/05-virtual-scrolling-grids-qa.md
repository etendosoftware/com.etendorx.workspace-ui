# **Test Plan: 05 - Data Grid Virtualization**

**Version:** 1.0
**Associated PRD:** PRD-06: Implementation of Virtual Scrolling for Grids
**Feature:** High-performance scrolling in data grids.

### **1. Objective**

The purpose of this test plan is to verify the performance, functionality, and stability of the virtual scrolling feature implemented in the application's main data grids. Testing will focus on scenarios with large datasets to ensure a smooth and error-free user experience.

### **2. Scope**

**In Scope:**

* Performance and functional testing of the `DynamicTable` component within the `MainUI` application.
* Verification of scrolling, selection, and interaction with large datasets.
* Testing on supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox).

**Out of Scope:**

* Testing the `Table` component in Storybook (covered by developer component tests).
* Testing with dynamic or variable row heights (this is a known technical constraint).

### **3. Test Environment & Prerequisites**

* **Environment:** A stable staging or pre-production build of the `MainUI` application.
* **Tools:**
* Standard web browser (latest Chrome recommended).
* Browser Developer Tools (specifically the Elements, Performance, and Memory panels).
* **Data Prerequisite:** Testers must have access to a view or a mechanism to load a table with at least 2,000 rows of data to properly simulate high-load conditions.

### **4. Test Cases**

#### **4.1. Performance Verification**

| Test Case ID | Description | Steps | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TC-PERF-01** | **DOM Node Count Verification** | 1. Navigate to the grid with 2,000+ rows. \<br\> 2. Open the Elements panel in DevTools. \<br\> 3. Inspect the table body and count the number of rendered row elements. \<br\> 4. Scroll the table from top to bottom. | The number of row elements must remain low and constant (approx. 20-40). It should not increase as you scroll. |
| **TC-PERF-02** | **Frame Rate (FPS) Verification** | 1. Navigate to the grid with 2,000+ rows. \<br\> 2. Open the Performance monitor in DevTools. \<br\> 3. Start a recording. \<br\> 4. Scroll the table rapidly up and down for 10 seconds. \<br\> 5. Stop the recording. | The FPS chart should remain consistently high (near 60 FPS, green). No significant "Long Tasks" or freezes should be reported during the scroll. |
| **TC-PERF-03** | **Memory Usage Verification** | 1. Navigate to the grid with 2,000+ rows. \<br\> 2. Open the Memory panel in DevTools. \<br\> 3. Take a heap snapshot. \<br\> 4. Reload the page with a small dataset (\~50 rows) and take another snapshot. | The memory usage for the large dataset should not be proportionally larger (e.g., 40x) than the small dataset. The increase should be minimal, proving that not all rows are held in memory. |

#### **4.2. Functional Verification**

| Test Case ID | Description | Steps | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TC-FUNC-01** | **Seamless Scrolling** | 1. Navigate to the grid with 2,000+ rows. \<br\> 2. Scroll slowly to the middle of the list. \<br\> 3. Scroll quickly to the bottom. \<br\> 4. Scroll quickly back to the top. | The scrollbar should accurately reflect the position in the list. No visual glitches, blank spaces, or flickering should occur at any point during the scroll. |
| **TC-FUNC-02** | **Row Selection Integrity** | 1. Select a single row near the top (e.g., Row \#5). \<br\> 2. Scroll to the bottom of the list. \<br\> 3. Scroll back to the top. | Row \#5 should still be visually and functionally selected. |
| **TC-FUNC-03** | **Multi-Selection Integrity** | 1. Select a row near the top (e.g., Row \#10). \<br\> 2. Scroll to the middle and select another row (e.g., Row \#1000) while holding Ctrl/Cmd. \<br\> 3. Scroll to the bottom and back to the top. | Both Row \#10 and Row \#1000 should remain selected. The selection count should be accurate. |
| **TC-FUNC-04** | **Row Interaction (Double-Click)** | 1. Scroll far down into the list (e.g., to Row \#1500). \<br\> 2. Double-click on Row \#1500 to open its detail view or form. | The detail view for the correct record (\#1500) must open. |
| **TC-FUNC-05** | **Interaction with Sorting/Filtering** | 1. Apply a sort to a column. \<br\> 2. Scroll through the sorted list. \<br\> 3. Apply a filter that reduces the list size. \<br\> 4. Scroll through the filtered list. | Virtualization must continue to function correctly in both sorted and filtered states without errors or visual glitches. |
| **TC-FUNC-06** | **Responsive Behavior** | 1. With the large grid visible, resize the browser window to be much smaller (height-wise). \<br\> 2. Resize it back to a larger size. | The virtualizer should correctly recalculate the visible rows, and scrolling should remain functional in all window sizes. |
